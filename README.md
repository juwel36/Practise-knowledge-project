# React + Vite

# Course-Registraition

Project Features :

1. **Course Selection and Cart Management:** Users can browse and select courses from the Course List, and when they click on a course select button, its title is added to the cart. The cart dynamically updates to display the selected courses, their prices, and credit hours. This feature provides an intuitive and interactive way for users to build their course list.

2. **Credit Hour Tracking:** The project keeps track of the total credit hours of the selected courses and displays the remaining credit hours. As users add  courses from their cart, this feature calculates and updates the remaining credit hours. This ensures that users can easily monitor their progress towards the 20-hour limit.

3. **Toast Alerts for Credit Hour Exceedance:** When the total credit hours in the cart exceed 20 hours, or when the remaining credit hours go below 0, the project displays React toast alerts.  This feature enhances the user experience by preventing them from adding too many courses and exceeding the credit hour limit.
